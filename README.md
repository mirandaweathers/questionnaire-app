# Interior Design Client Questionnaire

## Features

Designer dashboard for viewing client data.

## Requirements

This application uses Node.js. To run the application, your machine must have Node.js installed.

## Instructions

Save the repository to a new, empty folder on your machine.

In your machine's terminal, navigate to the folder where the repository is saved. Or, open a terminal in your IDE of choice, such as Visual Studio Code. Be sure you're in the main folder of the app, **not** in the client/ or server/ folder.

Type + run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will download the required node packages and start the application's client and server.

The server will run on localhost:3000.

The client will run on localhost:5173. 

Make sure those ports are not already in use!

Visit `localhost:5173` in your browser's address bar, and the app will be ready to use.
